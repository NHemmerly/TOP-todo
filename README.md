# TOP-todo
A todo-list project for The Odin Project


I wanted my version of this project to be different from the other projects
I saw from other Odin Project students. 

The primary difference between my todo list and other students projects 
is the use of cards to display all todo list data. First, larger scale projects
are saved as 'project cards' which themselves have a due date and title.
Each project card contains tasks that are only shown when a user 'clicks
into' a project. The nested style of organization is inspired by the idea 
that large scale tasks become much simpler when they're broken down into easily
understandable chunks. 

A good example of the use case of my todo list would be any programming 
project. Programming projects tend to start with one big idea, our
'project card' and then they're simplified with a bunch of smaller tasks, 
our 'task cards.' The task cards would include all of the steps needed to reach
the end goal of the project, such as programming validation for a form or 
coding the template for cards that appear on the screen into actually making
cards appear on the screen based on user input. 

A nice to have for this project would be a checklist included with each 
tasks where they can be divided into smaller increasingly managable
chunks.
